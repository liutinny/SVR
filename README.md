suppor vector regression used to forecast time series and other databases. (Matlab)


We will be working on matlab scripts to predict data. The main aim here is to get as high accuracy as possible.
I am sure here coding style doen't matter, all that is important is about the forecast models used and all.

Some references will be added later by ameya.
